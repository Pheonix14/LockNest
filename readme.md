## How It Works

- **Password Generation**:
  - The server generates a random password based on the user's preferences.
  - The password is encrypted using a randomly generated key before being sent to the client.

- **End-to-End Encryption**:
  - The client decrypts the password using the key received from the server.
  - The password is never transmitted or stored in plaintext.

- **Material You Design**:
  - The UI adapts to the user's system theme (light/dark mode) and follows Material You design style.

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**:
  - LockNest can be installed on your device for a native app-like experience.
